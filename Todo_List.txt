Write Tests:
    [x] r refect/reverse
    [ ] q quit
    [x] x absolute delta
        [ ] Write tests for beyond standard functionality

Implement:
    [x] r refect/reverse
    [ ] handle unknown instructions as r
    [ ] q quit
    [x] x absolute delta
    [ ] @ end the current IP 
    [x] ] turn right
    [x] [ turn left
    [x] w compare
    [ ] ; skip
    [x] j jump
    [ ] k iterate
    [ ] n clear the stack
    [ ] ' fetch character
    [ ] s store character
Other:
    [ ] change . instruction to print a space after the number printed
        [ ] Update any tests this breaks
    [ ] Add concurrency features
        [ ] IP list, tuples (IP,IP_delta,storage_offset)
    [x] fix issue with wrapping over the top not working correctly
