Write Tests:
    [x] r refect/reverse
    [ ] q quit
    [x] x absolute delta
        [ ] Write tests for beyond standard functionality
    [ ] @ end the current IP 
    [x] ] turn right
    [x] [ turn left
    [x] w compare
    [ ] ; skip
    [x] j jump forward
    [ ] k iterate
    [x] n clear the stack
    [ ] ' fetch character
    [ ] s store character
    [x] wrapping tests
    [x] trampoline tests
    [ ] get system info tests
Implement:
    [x] r refect/reverse
    [ ] handle unknown instructions as r
    [ ] q quit
    [x] x absolute delta
    [ ] @ end the current IP 
    [x] ] turn right
    [x] [ turn left
    [x] w compare
    [ ] ; skip
    [x] j jump
    [ ] k iterate
    [x] n clear the stack
    [ ] ' fetch character
    [ ] s store character
    [ ] # get system info
Other:
    [ ] change . instruction to print a space after the number printed
        [ ] Update any tests this breaks
        
    [x] fix issue with wrapping over the top not working correctly
    [ ] implement a run(funge_space) method, that takes a funge space as an argument, so different programs can be run without needing to start and stop the (python)iterpreter, should be backwards compatible with current functionality
[ ] Add concurrency features  
    [ ] IP list as a tuple (IP,IP_delta,storage_offset) 
        [x] Find all places where IP needs to be passed around
        [ ] Add/check appropriate changes
            [x][x] change_direction (line 73)
            [x][x] random_direction (line 87)
            [x][x] left_right_choice (line 91)
            [x][x] up_down_choice (line 98)
            [ ][ ] switch_string_mode (line 105)
                [ ] This may cause every other time where the tuple is passed around to also need a string_mode boolean in it.

    [ ] end_IP, how is it done?
